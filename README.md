## Abstract
  Road accidents is commonly caused by collision of vehicles, in pedestrians, all object that result to fatality, disability, and damage to property. Road accidents also caused by driver’s error, mechanical defect, over speeding, drinking before driving, and damage roads. This study will discuss and analyze about risk that caused accidents in CALABARZON Philippines. Driver's age is also a predictor of road accident criticality. It suggests that older drivers are more likely to be involved in critical road accidents than younger drivers. The criticality of road traffic accidents is also dependent on the congestion of the road. The huge volume of traffic limits driving speed, lowering the number of fatalities in accidents. Based on these findings, it is strongly recommended that heavier vehicles be subjected to tighter traffic restrictions. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that a motorists must be a driver license holder since most of the people involve on the road accidents are minor or underage which means that the age has something to do with the accidents. A driver's license isn't just a card yet it is an essential id that legally authorized a person to drive different vehicle in accordance to codes or restrictions. This research will help the Department of Transportation and Department of Public Works and Highways in assessing and regulating road accidents and how to further prevent them from occurring. Furthermore, this will also help in assessing the more complicated issues of the road. As for this, the study can be a guide for the drivers to lessen the fatalities on roads but their safety is still on their hands and the way they act on the road. This study can also serve as reference for future researchers. The findings of this study can be utilized and could enable the researchers to further develop and contribute more studies and analysis to this research.
## Introduction
  A road accident happens when there is a concussion between vehicles to vehicles, people, road environment or even animals, which is one of the leading causes of morbidity, damage or loss of properties, and even death. Based on the report analyzed by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the year 2018, a lot of people in the Philippines are dying due to road accidents. It doubles the number of incidents from 63,072  to 116,906 in 2018. Road accidents were the 14th leading cause of death in the Philippines but they are the second leading cause of death in terms of non-disease-caused deaths.  As it continous to increase day by day, it is now very alarming and become one of the major public health concern. 
  There are several factors why road accidents occur. It is clearly linked to the driver's mistake or behavior. Some of them are driving while inebriated or owing to broken roads and poor signage. In the Philippines, traffic is quite common, especially in Manila, which has the world's highest traffic index. Some manufacturing industries have moved to CALABARZON as a result of this lawsuit. As a result, many individuals are migrating to Region 4-A, increasing the number of vehicles on the road and increasing the risk of accidents. This project is being carried out to deliver and supply information based on data analysis that will aid in the development of an effective plan to identify the elements that influence road traffic accidents in Region IV-A CALABARZON.
## Problem Statement
Road accidents are the most terrifying thing that can happen to a driver. The majority of road users are aware of broad principles and safety procedures to take while on the road, yet accidents and crashes are caused by the road users' own irresponsibility. Accidents and wrecks are frequently caused by human error. Despite the existence of rules and regulations on the roads, it appears that reducing fatalities is impossible without the correct coordination and participation of the drivers. This paper intends to raise public awareness about road safety by highlighting the various risks that contribute to vehicle accidents in Region 4-A CALABARZON.
## Objectives:
The main objective of this study is to analyze the data related to the different factors that causes road accidents in Region 4-A CALABARZON.
Specifically, it aims to know the following:
1.	Acquire the statistics of accidents in CALABARZON and determine the main cause of these accidents.
2.	Determine which type of vehicle is most involved in road accidents.
3.	Determine where and why current risk control measures constantly fail.
4.	Identify which risk control measures need to be improved or what additional measures are necessary to prevent further incidents.
## Significance of the Proposed Project
It is important for drivers and motorheads to know how dangerous it is to be on the road and how many road accidents occur on a daily basis. This can help them be more cautious on the road, and at the same time, make them more compassionate and thoughtful with their fellow drivers. Thus, the researchers firmly believe that the development of this research is deemed significant and will be beneficial for drivers/motorists and for traffic officers or traffic police. This will enable everyone to have a safer and more efficient way of driving and traveling.
This research will help the Department of Transportation and Department of Public Works and Highways in assessing and regulating road accidents and how to further prevent them from occurring. Furthermore, this will also help in assessing the more complicated issues of the road.
This study can also serve as reference for future researchers. The findings of this study can be utilized and could enable the researchers to further develop and contribute more studies and analysis to this research. 
## Methods
This study will focus on data about a risk that causes accidents. By creating data about the factors that cause accidents, drivers are aware. The purpose of this study is to look into the elements that influence the criticality of road accidents as reported by descriptive indices like multiple lapses were used to examine the percentage In road traffic accidents, categorical characteristics such as gender and vehicle type have been linked.
## Expected Output
This study aims to give insights about incidents happening within Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon from the years 2016 to 2018 using analytical data. It will address how these incidents happen and the main reasons why they happen in certain places of CALABARZON. The datasets of these road accidents from PNP Regional Investigation and Detective Management Division of CALABARZON and ONEISS or Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the Regional Offices under Department of Health (DOH) will be utilized to determine the major reason for these incidents and determine the vehicles most involved with these incidents. This data will be used to generate a much more efficient way of preventing road accidents and will strengthen the existing road risk control measures today that will help the individuals most affected by these incidents which are the motorists and the drivers of the road.
The increasing number of vehicles and more significant traffic volumes lead to many more opportunities for road accidents. Those accidents became one of the primary causes of death for children and adults. It is ranked as 8th leading cause of death for all age groups. According to the 2018 Safety Status Report conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), vulnerable people bear a disproportionate amount of burden of road traffic accidents and deaths. This study aims to analyze the severity of road accident victims throughout the Region-4A. This research is conducted to provide a critical analysis from contributing and determinant factors, effects, and it's threat to people and bridge the gap by providing knowledge on factors that affect road  traffic accidents in Region 4-A CALABARZON.
## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project
The SDGs that this project aims to achieve are Sustainable Cities and Communities. These SDG is further described as follows;

•	Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities - This SDG aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. It involves investment in public transport, creating green public spaces, and improving urban planning and management in participatory and inclusive ways.
Sustainable Cities and Communities are in line with the proposal project which is the Risk Factors that Causes Road Accidents in Region 4A- CALABARZON. Road Safety Management for Local Government Units are advocating for a localized approached in the implementation of road safety programs to prevent and lessen the incidence of road crashes, road injuries, accidents and even deaths since most of these occur in city, municipal and provincial roads.
## Reliability of Organizations Where Data sets Originated
The proponents utlilized ONEISS or Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the Regional Offices under Department of Health (DOH) which is a web-based system that electronically store and collect injury related data. Also, the researchers use the data released by PNP Regional Investigation and Detective Management Division of CALABARZON which shows credibility and reliability of data sets gathered.
